* geodesic_public

This repository contains some of my code for the geodesic project.
In a browser, the notebooks are best viewed [[https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TheodoreEhrenborg/geodesic_public/tree/main/][here]].

~Amoeba_8Aug2020.ipynb~ is where I implemented the Amoeba minimization
algorithm from /Numerical Recipes/. 




~Status_update_15Aug2020.ipynb~ contains images of the various surfaces
I found in August.


In ~Plotting_dot20tau_10Dec2020.ipynb~, I find a quintic polynomial
that has an intersection angle of $ \tau / 5 = 2 \pi /5 $. I have
other notebooks to find the other surfaces, but the code in this
notebook is the neatest version yet.
